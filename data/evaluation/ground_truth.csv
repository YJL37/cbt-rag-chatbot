1,I think I failed the exam today. I’m such a failure.,"It seems you're upset because you think you failed the exam today. This setback must be weighting heavily on your mind. However, when it comes to considering your worth as a human being, it's important to define the criteria for failure. Especially, evaluating your value based on the result of one exam seems like an excessive judgment.
So, instead of thinking that you are a failure, consider that a part of your study process failed. At the same time, try to distinguish whether the failure was because your performance didn’t meet your expectations or because you didn’t understand certain problems. If you address the issues this way, you can view it as a problem-solving process within the learning experience, rather than labeling yourself as a failure."
2,"I’m having a conflict with my friend, and I’m so frustrated with them for not understanding my point of view.","You're feeling really upset because you had a fight with a friend. It's understandable—humans have a tendency to think from their own perspective, so sometimes it’s hard to fully understand the other person’s point of view. In situations like this, it’s important not just to leave things at the argument but also to reflect on what you might not have understood. It’s especially important to consider how your emotions may have led you to misunderstand the other person’s intentions. After that, you could try reaching out to your friend again. If you express that you didn’t fully understand their perspective and then clearly communicate your own thoughts, you might be able to reduce some of the hurt feelings and narrow the gap between your views."
3,"I don’t know how to balance my studies and my personal life, and I feel like I’m losing the connection I had with my friends.","It sounds like you're feeling upset because you feel distanced from your friends due to focusing so much on your studies. Dedicating yourself to something can sometimes bring a sense of loss in other areas of life. Balancing academics, work-life harmony, and maintaining friendships can be very challenging. In this situation, it might help to think carefully about what you truly want and write it down. Then, prioritize these desires, especially focusing on what’s most feasible to accomplish. By following through in order of priority, you may find a way to manage everything more effectively."
4,My parents keep scolding me for not doing enough work when I’m already trying my best. Am I not enough?,"It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from your parents, even though you're doing your best. Sometimes the difference in expectations between parents and children can create a heavy burden on the child. This doesn’t mean that you’re lacking in any way, but rather that the problem might stem from not clearly defining what those expectations are. Parents don’t always know everything about their child’s situation, and as a result, they often hold onto their own ideal standards rather than understanding the real circumstances.
To bridge this gap, it’s important to clearly explain your physical, psychological, and emotional state to your parents. At the same time, it’s essential to understand exactly what your parents’ expectations are and then discuss together what can realistically be achieved. When it comes to taking action, it’s crucial to start with the simplest tasks first. I encourage you to work with your parents to set priorities both in terms of expectations and in what you can realistically accomplish.
Lastly, remember that your worth isn’t determined by your parents. Take a moment to reflect on what you’ve achieved and what you’ve accomplished so far. Creating your own set of evaluation criteria based on this reflection can help you feel more confident in your efforts and progress."
5,"Everyone seems to be better than me. I wish I was as pretty as she was, or as smart as he was, or as rich as the people I see online.","You're feeling troubled because you find yourself thinking about others who seem smarter, more attractive, or wealthier than you. When you notice people who seem better off and start feeling inferior, it often stems from a desire within yourself to be better. However, it’s important to first consider whether these comparisons are fair. Comparisons driven by feelings of inferiority tend to focus only on the positive aspects of others, which can prevent you from seeing their flaws as well as your own strengths.
Additionally, everyone has their own way of living. Not everyone moves at the same pace or achieves success at the same time. Therefore, the most important thing is to check if you’re making progress on your own path."
6,"I feel envious of my friend. I know I’m supposed to support her, but I can’t help but feel jealous. What should I do?","You're feeling distressed because you're experiencing jealousy towards a friend. It can be upsetting and make you feel like you're a bad person, but it's important to understand that jealousy is a natural emotion that everyone feels at times. It doesn’t mean you dislike your friend; rather, it often arises when you want to do well but feel like you’re not achieving what you hoped for, especially when you compare yourself to someone who seems to be doing better.
Jealousy isn’t inherently a bad emotion, and it doesn’t have to manifest negatively. What’s more important is how you manage these feelings. When you feel jealous, try to clarify what your own goals are and create a list of actions you can take to achieve them. If you can use these feelings as motivation to work towards your goals, your jealousy might become a source of strength."
7,"Even if I go to a good university, I won’t be able to make it into a job, and I’ll live a monotonous life until I die. What’s the point of trying?","It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and increasingly skeptical because you keep getting the sense that the future looks bleak. This feeling often arises when you worry too much about the future. Such anxiety can deepen and lead to feelings of depression.
To address this, try focusing less on worrying about the future and more on creating actionable steps that lead to a better future. Making a practical list of things you can do today to move towards your goals can help shift your focus away from anxiety. Remember, no one can predict the future, and thinking about it won't necessarily lead to a better outcome.
Instead, concentrate on making today a good day. Effort does not betray you; even if it doesn't produce immediate results, it contributes to building a better life over time."
8,A friend that I’m close with is leaving the school. I don’t know what to do without her/him,"It sounds like you're worried and distressed because you've become distant from a close friend. Having a friend close by can be a great source of support, and the sense of loss you're feeling is quite natural. However, just because a close friend is no longer nearby doesn't mean you'll be completely alone. Remember that there are always people around you who care about and love you.
What might help is to prepare yourself emotionally for the change, as if you were anticipating a friend moving away. Plan how you can accept and manage your feelings during this transition. At the same time, think about how to make the most of the remaining time with your friend, creating as many positive memories as possible.
Lastly, keep in mind that your friendship doesn’t have to end just because your friend is moving away. Make plans to stay in touch, figure out how you will communicate and support each other, and set up future meetings. Creating and sticking to these plans can help you manage and accept the feelings of loss."
9,I’m so tired. I just want to let go,"It sounds like you're feeling so overwhelmed and exhausted that you want to give up on everything. When you reach a point where you feel like letting go, it often means that excessive effort has contributed to your current situation. While appropriate effort can keep you motivated and energized, too much effort can lead to burnout and the desire to quit.
First, identify what you might be overdoing and reduce it to a more manageable level. At the same time, consider how you can fill your remaining time with activities that prevent further burnout. If the workload is too much, seeking help is also a good option. Clarify what the core issues are and determine what actions are suitable for you moving forward. Taking these steps can help you manage your situation more effectively and avoid further exhaustion."
10,Are you sure CBT can help me?,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is indeed an effective approach. It’s a widely recognized method for influencing emotional change through adjustments in thinking and behavior. CBT is particularly helpful for addressing issues related to errors or distortions in thought patterns and when someone is unaware of or doesn’t know how to resolve these cognitive issues.
However, CBT may have limitations when dealing with deeply ingrained emotional wounds or issues rooted in the unconscious. While it is very effective for many common problems, it may not always fully address the complexities of more profound emotional traumas."
11,What is CBT?,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a therapeutic approach designed to restructure distorted thoughts and beliefs that shape human cognition, behavior, and emotions. It focuses on identifying and modifying distorted and exaggerated beliefs and setting concrete behavioral goals to facilitate change. The process generally unfolds in four stages: first, recognizing the specific problems or challenges that need to be addressed; second, examining the patterns of thinking and behavior contributing to these issues; third, developing and practicing more realistic and constructive ways of thinking; and finally, implementing changes in behavior to support and reinforce these new thought patterns.
While CBT is widely used and effective for many people, it does have limitations. It may not be as effective for very young children whose cognitive structures are still developing, or for individuals with significant unconscious issues. In such cases, CBT might struggle to address deeply ingrained or unconscious problems."
